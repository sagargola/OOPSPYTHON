''' In this program I am trying to explain the concept of Abstraction another OOPS concept. We will use
 abc module here since python doesnt have built in support for abstract class or interface'''

#Import the abc module to define abstract classes and methods

# Import the abc module to define abstract classes and methods

# Define an abstract class called Shape that has an abstract method called area
