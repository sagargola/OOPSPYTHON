# OOPSPYTHON
This is a basic OOPS python concept where I have used all the OOPS concepts and created 8 files which also covers threading in python and how to connect the databases.

The concept is similar in all the languages just the syntax is different. I have created files 1 to 8 and explained in a very simple way how the concept works.
